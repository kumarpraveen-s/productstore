# Product Management Web App

This is a simple full-stack web application that allows users to manage products with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The app allows adding, viewing, updating, and deleting products from an inventory system. Each product consists of a **name**, **price**, and an **image**.

- **Frontend**: React (JavaScript) using Vite for fast development and bundling.
- **Backend**: Node.js with ES Modules (using `import`/`export` syntax), connected to a **MongoDB** database for storing product data.

## Features

- **Add Products**: Users can add new products to the inventory with name, price, and an image.
- **View Products**: Display a list of all products with the option to filter and search.
- **Update Products**: Edit existing product details such as name, price, and image.
- **Delete Products**: Remove products from the inventory.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React (JavaScript), Vite (for faster builds and development)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js (using ES Modules)
- **Database**: MongoDB (using Mongoose for schema and model management)
